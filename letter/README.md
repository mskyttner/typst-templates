# Typst Letter Format

Based on tbe letter template published by the Typst team at <https://github.com/typst/templates/tree/main/letter>.

**NOTE**: This format requires the pre-release version of Quarto v1.4, which you can download here: <https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease>.

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template quarto-ext/typst-templates/letter
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your document.

## Using

Specify the sender, receipient, subject, etc. using YAML options, then write the body of the letter. For example, the following qmd source:

```yaml
---
subject: "Revision of our Procurement Contract"
name: "Jane Smith \ Regional Director"
sender: "Jane Smith, Universal Exports, 1 Heavy Plaza, Morristown, NJ 07964"
